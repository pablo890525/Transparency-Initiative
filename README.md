# Data Transparency Publication Services

PDEL’s data publication services works with UCSD researchers to streamline code, anonymize personally identifying data, organize files, and replicate analyses. The end product is an easy-to-navigate folder with complete replication materials that can be submitted to journals and migrated into the UCSD Library Digital Collection.
